I'm a startup founder and software engineer who is passionate about education, hiring, and tech. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Elixir, flutter, ReactJS, and python. In 2022, I started  <a href="https://lazul.io/">Lazul Software, Inc.</a>--a software marketplace to enable skills-first hiring and education.
